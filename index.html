        <h2>Writer, Artist, Master's Student</h2>
        	<p>Riley is currently pursuing her Masters of Science in Museums and Digital Culture at Pratt Institute, Riley Trist is interested in stories — those that belong to her, to the people around her, and to those who have had their stories controlled and repressed.</p>
        	<p>This fascination with storytelling manifested itself as a focus on art, illustration, and writing where she had a chance to tell her own story, including writing and publishing a novel. However, when she was given both the opportunity to volunteer as an elementary school art teacher and to design some exhibitions for galleries and museums around Los Angeles County, she saw that the way people’s stories are told is often manipulated by those who are in control of them. These experiences helped her transform her interest in storytelling and passion for other people’s stories into a way of giving people a platform where they are invited to showcase those stories.</p>
