        <p>A team of other students and I curated and designed a virtual exhibition for The Museum of the San Fernando Valley focusing on the changing cultural landscape of communities in the 1970s and today, and how that brought their members to create public art.  I was part of the curation team focused on murals from the 1970s, and assembled a coherent narrative about the history of those communities through my research.</p>
